NftHolding Data Overview

The NftHolding data provides insights derived from aggregated information 
related to the holdings of NFTs associated with a user. 

Nft Components
Each Nft consists of the following key components:
    1.Chain: Represented as a string, this indicates the blockchain network
     on which the NFT holding exists. It could be any supported chain, such as Ethereum, 
     Solana, or others. 
     If the NFT holding is not associated with any registered chain, 
     the value is "not registered." will be returned for this field

    2.Token Address: This represents the unique address of the NFT contract
     where the tokens are held. For solana this would be the program address,
     For Ethereum smart contract address

    3.Amount: This numeric value represents the quantity of NFTs held at the 
    given token address. It provides insights into the size of the users NFT collection.

    4.Name: A  string that may indicate the name or label associated with the 
    NFT collection. It offers additional context about the holdings.

    5.MeasurementDate: The date the nft was measured on our data wallet. More detail below

While there are other components of NFTs that differ based on different chains,
 the above-mentioned fields are of primary interest for answering queries.

MeasurementDate in NFT Data

When answering queries, we establish a benchmark based on the query launch date.
Any event or change that occurs after this benchmark date is not considered in 
our query responses. This creates an issue regarding NFTs,
since NFTs are designed for transferability,a user may have diffirent assets
given a spesific time.

In order overcome this and give a metric for our data staleness we use
measurementDate, this date essentially allows us to build snapshots of nfts 
associated with our users. We store the date of measurement with the event (added:1 removed:2 )
   
    "totalAmount": "1",
    "history": [
        {
            "measurementDate": 1701779730,
            "event": 1
            "amount": 1
        }
    ]

and when answering queries we get the valid ones ( the ones that are measured before query launch date ),
if our latest measurementDate is before the query launch time we do another check and then answer with latest date


Aggregation of Nft Data

NFT data is aggregated based on blockchain networks and organized for analysis.
We include the latest measurementTime in the aggregated data, which is then used for marketing analytics and query responses.
class NftHolding {
  public constructor(
    public chain: keyof typeof EChain | "not registered",
    public tokenAddress: TokenAddress,
    public amount: number,
    public name: string,
    public measurementTime: UnixTimestamp,
  ) {}
}

and send it as response to the marketing platform.
