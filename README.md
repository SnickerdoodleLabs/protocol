# Snickerdoodle Protocol

![Architecture Diagram](/documentation/images/protocol-architecture.png)

The Snickerdoodle Protocol (the Protocol) is a decentralized platform for privacy-enhancing data analysis and customer incitivization, that fundamentally shifts how such things are done in favor of the actual user. The Protocol is open and extensible, allowing for uses beyond the original vision. The Protocol defines a Data Wallet (DW), that is controlled by the user, into which their personal data is put and collected, entirely at their discretion. Consumers of the protocol can use the Snickerdoodle Query Language (SDQL) to request an Insight from user's DWs in exchange for some form of reward. The Query Engine part of the wallet will process the SDQL request and return the Insight at the consent of the user, making it a form of distributed computing.
