# Vector DB

--- This package is a stand-alone package that can be used outside of the base protocol and its various form factors ---

This package contains objects and methods that comb through an indexed database and returned individualized, quantized tables.  This normalized data is then set for unsupervised machine learning algorithms to classify table data and infer on possible groupings.
