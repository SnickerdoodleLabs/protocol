# Signature Verification

These are the definitions used for various calls to the Insight Platform that require signatures by the data wallet. When using CryptoUtils.signTypedData() in common-utils, you require a data schema for the data. This package contains the schemas used. These are used along with the Insight Platform openapi schema.
